# Huge volume of test data

## 1. Description.
In certain business scenarios, we require a standalone analysis tool to handle large volumes of data in an isolated environment. After developing the data analysis tool with Veax (details to be shared later), we need a substantial amount of structured data for testing. This project aims to generate large-volume data files using Python scripts that employ multiprocessing techniques to ensure efficient data generation.

## 2. Data list. 
Typical sales circle data. Including:

- Invoice
- Customer
- Product

## 3. Test

- Grouping, Sorting, Filtering.
- Can be joined by keywords.  99% keywords match each other.  Unmatch records for data quality checking.
